# Default Middleware

For checking against a single permission (see Best Practices) using `can`, you can use the built-in Laravel middleware provided by `\Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\Authorize::class` like this:

```php
Route::group(['middleware' => ['can:publish articles']], function () {
    //
});
```
